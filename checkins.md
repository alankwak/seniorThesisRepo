## Week 1 Summary (09/08/2025-09/15/2025)

### This week I worked on:

* I tried to brainstorm project ideas, such as an app that allows users to create their own objects and then pack them into a 3D space such as a box. I am not 100% set on this idea, but I think it would be cool to make and could include a lot of different technologies (computer vision/LIDAR for item creation, bin packing in a new computational language (e.g. Rust), a new web framework (e.g. Angular)).
* I probably worked for about 2 hours this week, which is less than I would have liked to. This is mostly because I was in the process of finalizing the topic for my math thesis. I should be able to work more on this project next week. I would also like to come up with some other ideas to consider besides the packing app.

### This week I learned:

* I learned about Apple's built-in object scanning on iPhones.

### My successes this week were:

* I have a pretty good idea of what I might do to create a packing app, though I'd like to come up with some other ideas as well.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

* I didn't have many challenges this week other than the uncertainty that comes with brainstorming.

## Week 2 Summary (09/15/2025-09/22/2025)
### This week I worked on:

* My plans for this week were pretty much upended following the event of me learning that you need a Mac to really do any kind of iPhone app development. I don't know how I didn't realize this before, but this essentially blocks me from testing one of the main features of my proposed bin-packing app: 3D scanning items to easily add them to a packing list. This is because I own an iPhone, and would thus not be able to easily test any camera functionality on a mobile app. I am open to making modifications to the packing concept that I could realistically develop, but I honestly think the app is better suited to mobile than desktop/web so I decided to research other project ideas.
* One idea I thought of was essentially a way to share tabs across browsers of different users, which I think would be useful for things like group research projects so everyone can navigate to an article of interest without having to manually share links. It could also be cool as a group shopping tool so people in a group can easily find products that other group members are interested in. I would probably implement this through a browser extension.
    * I don't know if this is enough for a senior project, and I need to come up with additional features

### This week I learned:

* I spent a little bit of time researching if this new idea is actually possible as a browser extension, and it seems like it is. It might require a back end to actually route requests to the correct browsers, though.

### My successes this week were:

* Despite realizing my packing idea isn't feasible for me to make since I can't really develop for iPhone, I came up with a new idea that I still think is cool.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

* I was sick for a majority of the week, so I didn't have the energy to do much research.
* I also had to come up with a new idea for a project, which came with a bit of frustration trying to find an idea that I thought was cool and had not been overdone.

## Week 3 Summary (09/22/2025-09/29/2025)
### This week I worked on:

* I met with Professor Mahoney and pitched the tab-sharing extension idea. He said it sounded good.
* I wrote the most essential use-cases for the tab-sharing extension in ```README.md```.

### This week I learned:

* I learned how to write use cases for a project idea.

### My successes this week were:

* I finalized a project idea and made progress by writing use cases for it.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

* I did not feel I had any challenges this week.

## Week 4 Summary (09/29/2025-10/06/2025)
### This week I worked on:

* I updated ```README.md``` with an additional product overview (adding to the use-cases I wrote last week).
* I did some preliminary research into developing a chrome extension.

### This week I learned:

* I learned that I will probably be using the Chrome .tabs API the most for this project, and that Chrome has a built-in sidebar that extensions can use.

### My successes this week were:

* I made steady progress on my project.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

* I did not feel I had any challenges this week.

## Week 5 Summary (10/06/2025-10/13/2025)
### This week I worked on:

* To be honest, I did not work much on my project this week. I was busy with tests in other classes and interview prep for internships.
* I did watch a short video about how to create a basic chrome extension and then test it using Chrome's developer mode for extensions.

### This week I learned:

* I learned how to test a custom chrome extension locally without actually publishing it. I have a feeling testing my extension will be a little more involved since the functionality is based on multiple machines but it might be as simple as just running the same development extension on the otehr machine at the same time.

### My successes this week were:

* I learned how to test a custom chrome extension.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

* I had trouble finding time to work on this project among various other projects and responsibilities I had this week.
