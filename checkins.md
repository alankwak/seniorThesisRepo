## Week 1 Summary (MM/DD/YYYY)

### This week I worked on:

* I tried to brainstorm project ideas, such as an app that allows users to create their own objects and then pack them into a 3D space such as a box. I am not 100% set on this idea, but I think it would be cool to make and could include a lot of different technologies (computer vision/LIDAR for item creation, bin packing in a new computational language (e.g. Rust), a new web framework (e.g. Angular).
* I probably worked for about 2 hours this week, which is less than I would have liked to. This is mostly because I was in the process of finalizing the topic for my math thesis. I should be able to work more on this project next week. I would also like to come up with some other ideas to consider besides the packing app.

### This week I learned:

* I learned about Apple's built-in object scanning on iPhones.

### My successes this week were:

* I have a pretty good idea of what I might do to create a packing app, though I'd like to come up with some other ideas as well.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

* I didn't have many challenges this week other than the uncertainty that comes with brainstorming.
